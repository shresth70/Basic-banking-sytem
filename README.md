### README: Basic Banking System  

---

#### **Overview**  
The Basic Banking System is an interactive C-based program designed to simulate fundamental banking operations. It provides users with a simple interface to check balances, deposit funds, withdraw money, and exit the system. This program demonstrates core programming concepts and is ideal for beginners learning C.

#### **Features**  

**Account Management:**  
- **Check Balance:** View the current balance of the virtual account.  
- **Deposit Money:** Add funds to the account. Ensures only positive values are accepted.  
- **Withdraw Money:** Deduct funds from the account, with checks for valid amounts and sufficient balance.  
- **Exit:** Safely terminates the program with a closing message.  

**Error Handling:**  
- Handles invalid inputs for menu choices, deposits, and withdrawals.  
- Displays clear error messages for insufficient balance or negative inputs.  

---

#### **Requirements**  
- A C compiler, such as GCC.  
- A terminal or IDE to compile and execute the program.  

---

#### **Usage Instructions**  
1. **Compile the Program:**  
   Use the following command to compile the program:  
   ```bash  
   gcc basic_banking_system.c -o banking_system  
   ```  

2. **Run the Program:**  
   Execute the compiled binary:  
   ```bash  
   ./banking_system  
   ```  

3. **Interact with the Menu:**  
   - Choose an option by entering its corresponding number:  
     - `1` to check balance.  
     - `2` to deposit money.  
     - `3` to withdraw money.  
     - `4` to exit the program.

#### **File Structure**  
- **Source File:**  
  `basic_banking_system.c`  

---

#### **Limitations**  
- No persistent data storage; balances reset when the program is restarted.  
- No support for advanced banking features like transaction history or multi-user accounts.  

---

#### **Future Enhancements**  
- Implement persistent storage to save account balances across sessions.  
- Add transaction history tracking for better transparency.  
- Create a graphical user interface for improved user interaction.
